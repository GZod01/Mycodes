        <b>Host your pages on my site!</b>
        <p>Hello, you want to host pages but you don't know how ?</p>
        <p>There are several ways to do this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You're a developer and you have good skills in HTML, JAVASCRIPT etc:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Prepare your file or folder
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Send me your file or folder
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Wait that I read your file or folder to verify that it is secure
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>You're a begginer and you want learn html:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Read the W3Schools courses or other to learn HTML (I maybe will create some articles to teach you the html)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Send me your code, and same steps that experimented developer...
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                You're a begginner and don't want to learn html or want to do this by the future:
                <ol>
                    <li>Send me what you wan't your page to be like and I will create this for you...</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
